Static:
 The memory allocation for static variables will be done once its class gets loaded. Thats why the value for static variables cant be changed for every objects.

Non-Static:\
 The memory allocation for non-static variables will be done only when the object gets created. Thats why the value for non-static variables can be changed for every objects.
