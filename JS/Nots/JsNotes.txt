PRIMITIVE DATATYPES:

	1. NUMBER
	2. STRING
	3. BOOLEAN
	4. NULL
	5. UNDEFINED


REFERENCE DATA TYPE:


	1. ARRAYS:

		var arr1=[1,2,3]
	
		Note:
		1. It is a collection of data.
		2. Array in javascript can be homogeneous or heterogeneous .
		3. We can have object inside an array.




	2. OBJECT:
		1. It is an entity which have its oun states and behaviours.
		2. object states are stored as key and value pairs.
		3. They should be seperated by comas.

		Syntax:

		var Variable_name={
				
				key : value,
				key : value
			  }

		Example:

		var emp = {

			name : "murugan",
			age : 49
		  }

		OBJECT INSIDE AN OBJECT:

		EXAMPLE:

		var empl={
			
		name : "abc",
		id :{
			id : 30,
			age : 80
		    }
		 }

		OBJECT INSIDE AN ARRAY:

			var arr=[1,emp1]

	
	3. DATE
	4. MATH
	5. FUNCTION


STATEMENT:

	Something that yields results.

	OPERANDS:
		Operands are the values on wich operators work.

		TYPES:
		1. Variables
		2. Literals
	OPERATORS:
		The operators are the symbols which have its own dedicated functionality.

		TYPES OF OPERATORS:
		1. Arithmetic Operators
		2. Comparision / Relational Operators
		3. Logical Operators
		4. Ternary Operators
		5. TypeOf Operators

		Arithmetic OPerators:
			{ +,-,%,/,*,++,-- }
	
		Comparision Operators:
			{ <,>,<=,>=,!=,==,===(Strictly Eaual to),!==(Strictly not Equal to) }
		
				=== , !== : Strictly equal to compares datatype of the values and also values
				 == , !=  : It compares only values.

		Logical Operators:
			{ AND(&&), OR(||), NOT(!) }

		Ternary Operators:
			1. It uses ? and : to perform If else condition.

			 Syntax : (condition)?If Statement:Else statement;
			Example : var a = (1>2)?True:False;

		TypeOf OPerator:
			1. It will provide the type of the given variable.
			
			Syntax  : typeOf(var_name);
			Example : 
				var a=1=;
				typeOf(a); -----> number

			Note:
				1. Type of null is Object.
				2. Type of Undefined is Undefined.
				4. Type of Array is Object.
TEMPLATE LITERALS:

	1. Template Literals allow embedded Expressions.
	2. It should be enclosed within Backticks(`).

	Syntax:
		`string ${expression} string`
	Example:
		var a=true;
		Console.log(`the value gives ${a} as the result`)
